# This is the code I used to complete the modelling project in MATH585.
The code models the volume of droplets made in a microfluidic T-junction to replicate the results presented in Van Steijn V, Kleijn C.R., Kreutzer M.T. (2010) Predictive model for the size of bubbles and droplets created in microfluidic T-junctions. *Lab on a Chip.* **10**, 2513-2518
